    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This lemony salmon and orzo casserole is a one-dish dinner that's packed with omega-3 fatty
        acids—a polyunsaturated fat in salmon that can help tame inflammation and may even help lower
        blood pressure. Here, omega-3-rich salmon sits on top of an orzo mixture that bakes in the
        oven, instead of boiling on the stovetop,
        absorbing all the bright and lemony flavors while it cooks.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small lemon</li>
        <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 medium leeks, light green and white parts only, thinly sliced (about 1 1/4 cups)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons capers, rinsed, divided</li>
        <li>4 cups lower-sodium vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 cups whole-wheat orzo</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds skinless salmon fillet, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces (3 cups)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill plus 1/4 cup, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 425°F. Cut lemon in half crosswise. Thinly slice 1 lemon half;
            remove and discard seeds and lemon end. Juice the remaining lemon half to yield 1
            tablespoon juice; set aside. Place the lemon slices, tomatoes, leeks, garlic, 2 tablespoons
            oil and 1 tablespoon capers in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish; toss to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake, uncovered, until the tomatoes have begun to burst and the lemon has softened,
            15 to 18 minutes. Remove from oven; gently stir in broth, orzo and 1 teaspoon salt.
            Cover with foil.
            Bake until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the orzo is al dente, 20 to 26 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, season salmon and asparagus with pepper and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt;
            drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil.
        </li>
        <li>Once the orzo is al dente, remove the baking dish from the oven; stir in the asparagus
            and 2 tablespoons dill. Nestle the salmon into the orzo mixture. Bake, uncovered, until
            the salmon is cooked
            through and flakes easily when tested with a fork, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, combine the reserved 1 tablespoon lemon juice and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil,
            1 tablespoon capers and 1/4 cup dill in a small bowl. Serve the sauce alongside the casserole.
        </li>
    </ol>
