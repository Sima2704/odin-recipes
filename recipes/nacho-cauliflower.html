    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cauliflower casserole is inspired by nachos and stuffed
        with tender roasted cauliflower,
        sweet red pepper and brown rice. Salsa helps bind the ingredients together, along with melted
        cheese. Crushed tortilla chips on top add crunch. Serve with the suggested garnishes,
        or add your own favorite toppings to complete the dish.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium head cauliflower, cored and sliced (1/2-inch; about 6 cups)</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, sliced (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 medium poblano pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lower-sodium taco seasoning</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added black beans, rinsed</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked brown rice</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen corn, thawed</li>
        <li>1 cup chunky salsa</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Mexican-blend cheese, divided</li>
        <li>3 cups unsalted corn tortilla chips, coarsely crushed</li>
        <li>Loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, sliced jalapeño peppers,
            sour cream and/or lime wedges for garnish
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Position rack in bottom of oven; preheat to 425°F. Arrange cauliflower, onion,
            bell pepper and poblano on a large rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle
            with taco seasoning and salt; toss to coat. Spread into an even layer. Roast, stirring
            once, until the vegetables are
            browned and crispy around the edges, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Lightly coat a 3-quart baking dish with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the roasted vegetables to a large bowl. Stir in beans, rice, corn,
            salsa and 1/2 cup cheese. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish.
            Sprinkle with tortilla chips. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup cheese over the top.
            Cover loosely with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until
            the casserole is hot throughout and the cheese is melted and browned, about 10 minutes more.
            Garnish with cilantro, jalapeños, sour cream and/or lime wedges, if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
